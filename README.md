## How to run locally for testing purposes

To run project locally you need Docker be installed. I created tool to simplify build/run process `manager.sh`.

* to build/re-build project run `manager.sh build`. 
* to run project run `manager.sh run` by default it run in foreground, so you can easy see any errors (I hope that they will not be, but this is real life).
